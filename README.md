# Prediction of Solar Power Genrtion using ML Technique
Here we are using various algorith of Machine learing for copmaprison of getting highest accuracy of power genration algorithms are-
1.Logistic Regression
2.Linear Regression
3.Decision Tree Regression
4.Random Forest Regression
5.Support vector Regression
6.Lasso Regrssion

Used Python Packages are:
1.Sklearn:
          . In python ,sklearn is amachine learning package which include a lot of ML algorithm
          . Here, we are using some of its modules like train_test_split, DecisionTree Classifier or Logistic Regression and Accuracy score.
          
2.Numpy:
          . It is a numeric python module which provodes fast maths function  for calculations.
          . Its is used to read data in numpy array and for manipulation purpose.
          
3.Pandas:
         . Used to read and write different files.
         . Data manipulation can be done easily with data frames
         
4.Mathplotib:
         . Data visulization is a useful way to help with identify the patterns from given dataset.
         .Data manipulation can be done easily with data frames.
